        <!-- When to Go Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>When to Go</h2>
            <p>There is no bad time to visit Switzerland! It just depends on what you are looking for during your trip. If you're looking for a holiday full of winter sports, then winter is the best time to go. Between November and February, the snow season is at its peak. Skiing and snowboarding are incredible, and all of Switzerland looks like a winter wonderland.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Getting Around</h2>
            <p>Public transport is very well-maintained and easy to follow, and many locals speak English as well. So if you ever get lost or have a hard time finding a place you want to go, it's easy to get back on track.</p>
            <div class="tip-card">
                <h4>Trains</h4>
                <p>Trains are the fastest and most efficient way to travel between cities. Buses are a bit slower and cheaper.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-card">
                <h4>Renting a Car</h4>
                <p>Renting a car is another option. The roads are easy to drive and well-maintained, though renting a car is still more expensive than public transport.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-card">
                <h4>Bicycles</h4>
                <p>Bicycles can be taken on most SBB trains, private railways, and PostBuses as long as you buy a separate bike ticket or Day Bike Pass.</p>
